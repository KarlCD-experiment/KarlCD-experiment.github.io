            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Karlitos, born Carlo Denti on March 27th, 2010 in Catania and raised in Riposto, showed musical talent from a very young age. At age 5, his parents took him to piano lessons in Acireale, where his teacher discovered he had a natural musical ear. Over the years, Karlitos switched piano teachers several times, but since 2021, he has been studying with Erika LoGiudice, his current piano teacher.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2022, Karlitos began composing his first melodies on the piano and was gifted an iPad by his parents. With this, he produced his first instrumentals and published them on SoundCloud. In 2023, he received a computer that allowed him to perfect his production skills and sound. After experimenting with multiple DAWs, Karlitos ultimately settled on Ableton Live Suite, where he continues to compose, produce new songs, and has started incorporating vocals into his work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from music, Karlitos is also passionate about filmmaking, videomaking, screenwriting, and editing, blending his love for creativity into multiple art forms.
